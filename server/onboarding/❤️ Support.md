## GitHub

If you have a GitHub account then you can also submit bugs directly to the development team on our public [issue tracker](https://github.com/outline/outline/issues).

## Ideas

We’d love to hear your ideas about how Outline can be improved and features you would like to see built. The best place to let the team know is through [GitHub discussions](https://github.com/outline/outline/discussions).
