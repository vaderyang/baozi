# Architecture

Outline is composed of a backend and frontend codebase in this monorepo. As both are written in Javascript, they share some code where possible. We utilize the latest ES6 language features, including `async`/`await`, and [Flow](https://flow.org/) typing. Prettier formatting and ESLint are enforced by CI.

## Frontend

Outline's frontend is a React application compiled with [Webpack](https://webpack.js.org/). It uses [MobX](https://mobx.js.org/) for state management and [Styled Components](https://www.styled-components.com/) for component styles. Unless global, state logic and styles are always co-located with React components together with their subcomponents to make the component tree easier to manage.

> Important Note: The Outline editor is built on [Prosemirror](https://github.com/prosemirror) and managed in a separate open source repository to encourage re-use: [rich-markdown-editor](https://github.com/outline/rich-markdown-editor).

```
app
├── components  - React components reusable across scenes
├── embeds      - Embed definitions that represent rich interactive embeds in the editor
├── hooks       - Reusable React hooks
├── menus       - Context menus, often appear in multiple places in the UI
├── models      - State models using MobX observables
├── routes      - Route definitions, note that chunks are async loaded with suspense
├── scenes      - A scene represents a full-page view that contains several components
├── stores      - Collections of models and associated fetch logic
├── types       - Flow types
└── utils       - Utility methods specific to the frontend
```

## Backend

The API server is driven by [Koa](http://koajs.com/), it uses [Sequelize](http://docs.sequelizejs.com/) as the ORM and Redis with [Bull](https://github.com/OptimalBits/bull) for queues and async event management. Authorization logic
is contained in [cancan](https://www.npmjs.com/package/cancan) policies under the "policies" directory.

```

## Shared

Where logic is shared between the client and server it is placed in this directory. This is generally
small utilities.

```

├── styles            - Styles, colors and other global aesthetics
├── utils             - Shared utility methods
└── constants         - Shared constants
